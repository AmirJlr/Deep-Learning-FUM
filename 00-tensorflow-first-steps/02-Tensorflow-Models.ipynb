    "- #### `Loss function (objective function)`—The quantity that will be minimized during training. It represents a measure of success for the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### `Optimizer`—Determines how the network will be updated based on the loss function. It implements a specific variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### `Metrics`—The measures of success you want to monitor during training and validation, such as classification accuracy. Unlike the loss, training will not optimize directly for these metrics.\n",

    "### The fit() method implements the `training loop` itself. These are its key arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### The data (inputs and targets) to train on.\n",
    "- #### The number of epochs to train for.\n",
    "- #### The batch size to use within each epoch of mini-batch gradient descent: the number of training examples considered to compute the gradients for one weight update step.\n",

    "### Inference: Using a model after training :\n",
    "#### Once you’ve trained your model, you’re going to want to use it to make predictions on new data. This is called inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A better way to do inference is to use the `predict()` method. It will iterate over the data in small batches and return a NumPy array of predictions.\n"
